Here's a brief overview of how Ragdoll came to be.

**In 2008** I graduated from Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola and ventured into the world as character animator at Meindbender; to work on [The Duplicators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhSwlFW5r8) and [The Pirate](https://vimeo.com/22342702) amongst others.

**In 2012** I joined Framestore and familiarised myself with the world of physics simulation, developing the technology behind the tethers for a team of 10 in Alfonso Cuaron's feature film Gravity, and later completed work on the Cloak of Leviation in Doctor Strange.

**In 2015** I started a company called Abstract Factory developing tools in Python for use in production pipelines, including Avalon, Pyblish, Qt.py and Allzpark; later recieving the "Best Tool" award for Pyblish at the 2020 DigiPro/The Pipeline Conference.

**In 2017** I started a company called WeightShift with co-founders Danny Chapman and Tim Daust. They had just wrapped up the Endorphin and Euphoria projects at Natural Motion.

Like Euphoria, WeightShift developed a physically based animation tool, except this one was tailed to Autodesk Maya and got adoptbed by major feature film studios including Framestore (Harry Potter, Gravity et. al.) and Weta Digital (Avatar, Lord of the Rings et. al.)

**In 2020** Epic purchases WeightShift

**In 2020** `Ragdoll enters chat`

Ragdoll carries on where WeightShift left off, but turns things on its head. Rather than targeting riggers and technical animators, Ragdoll adopts a "no-rigging required" approach.

**In 2021** Ragdoll is released.
