Highlight of this release is **Support for Scale** and **Replay**!

- [**ADDED** Replay](#replay) Animator-friendly automation, fresh off the stove
- [**ADDED** Support for Scale](#scale) Ragdoll now works on scaled geometry and controls
- [**ADDED** Support for NURBS Surfaces](#nurbs-surfaces) This hip new thing popularised in the 90s is now yours to reap!
- [**ADDED** Visualise Output Attributes](#output-attributes) Gain insight into what comes out of the solver
- [**FIXED** Zombie Attributes](#zombie-attributes) Delete All Physics didn't quite catch'em all

## Replay

Ever set-up a character with physics, only to have to do it all over again on some other shot or character? With **Replay** this can be a thing of the past. :)

If you've ever worked with Photoshop and it's "Actions" panel, you'll know what to expect. It'll record the things you do, such that you can replay them later. For every recorded action, selection and preferences are stored. You can edit the names of selected nodes with *wildcards* to support alternative naming conventions, for example if a control has a different namespace than originally recorded at. Preferences can be manipulated post-recording as well, such as the initial shapes of things.

## Scale

Up till now, scale would have either broken a simulation or refused to work outright. Not anymore! Now you can simulate *scaled controls*.

|    | Feature                        | Example
|:--:|:-------------------------------|:------------------
| ✔️ | Uniform Scale                 | `1.5, 1.5, 1.5`
| ✔️ | Non-uniform Scale             | `0.5, 0.6, 0.12`
| ✔️ | Mixed Positive/Negative Scale | `0.9, -1.5, -1.1`
| ✔️ | Negative Scale                | `-1.5, -1.5, -1.5`
| ✔️ | Zero Scale                    | `0.0, 0.0, 0.0`
| ✔️ | Mixed Zero Scale              | `1.0, 0.0, 1.0`
| ✔️ | Non-uniform Negative Scale    | `-1.0, 1.0, -2.0`
| ✔️ | Scaled parent(s)              | Scaled root control
| ✔️ | Mixed Scale & Constraints     | Scaled box to differently-scaled capsule

There are a few caveats.

#### Scale does not affect rotation

Uniform scale normally doesn't affect rotation, but *non-uniform* scale could. Let's look at this visually.

Here, we've got a single angle of 45 degrees. If you were to scale this horizontally, you can see how the angle now changes! At a scale of 0, the angle has gone from 45 degrees to 90 degrees.

This complicates things a lot, and Ragdoll saves you from that by not taking non-uniform scale into consideration for its rotations. A 45 degree angle will remain 45 degree regardless of scale; with the exception of negative scales which still flip the angle as you'd expect.

## NURBS Surfaces

Ragdoll could translate polygon meshes and NURBS *curves* into collision meshes, and today I'm happy to announce that it now also supports the latest trend in computer graphics, heavily used in the 90s at Dreamworks for critically acclaimed feature animatinon films Antz and Shark Tale.

Join the future!

## Output Attributes

The Attribute Editor now displays the output translate, rotate and scale attributes from each rigid body.

These are the values that feed into your animation control, or any transform you're simulating.

## Zombie Attributes

The `Delete All Physics` menu item didn't catch the last remaining `Local Strength` attribute created by `Create Dynamic Control`. This is all patched up!
