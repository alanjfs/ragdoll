## Support for Maya 2022

Ready when you are, Python 3 and all!

**Caveats**

Maya 2022 introduced the concept of "trusted plug-in" which means anything not from Autodesk or the Autodesk Exchange needs user-approval before installation.

Ragdoll currently installed 2 plug-ins that make an appearance on first load in Maya 2022, one for `ragdoll` and another for a bundled plug-in called [`cmdx`](https://github.com/mottosso/cmdx).

Click the "Apply to all plugins in this location" to get rid of the dialog for good.

### Backwards Compatibility

What does breaking backwards compatibility of a dynamics solver look like?

**Original**

**Last Release**

He's the same person! Only the circumstances have changed. :D This has now been fixed, and all previous examples now open and run as expected!

### Accurate Gravity

The indicator used to face in the Y-axis of wherever the node was facing. That wasn't true. It's now accurate no matter how you spin it around, including a potential Z-up axis!

### Ragdoll Explorer

Added an early version of a visual interface for the `cmds.ragdollDump()` command, something to inspect the internals of the solver. Mostly intended for game developers but also advanced users and techincal directors.
