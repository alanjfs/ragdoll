### Solver Iterations

Anything called `strength` in Ragdoll is a multipler for `stiffness` and `damping`. And currently there's a ceiling to how high `stiffness` and `damping` values can go, after which point they just stop having an effect.

The values are limited by how many "iterations" you let the solver perform. Per default, they are set to `8` and can be found at `rdRigid.positionIterations`.

This release sheds some more light on this somewhat obscure attribute by exposing it directly on the solver, right next to `Substeps`.

This value *multiplies* each `rdRigid.positionIterations` attribute, meaning a value of `2` yields a total iteration count for every rigid in the solver of `16` (i.e. `2 * 8`).

Which means you can now do this!

You can further customise iteration counts per rigid, under the Advanced tab.

There's no limit to how many iterations you can allow; more iterations means greater accuracy. However, I have found that values beyond 128 tend to get funky.

| Iteration Count | Description
|:----------------|:-------------
| `8`             | Default, sensible for most uses
| `16`            | High
| `32`            | Really, really high
| `64`            | Ultra Nightmare

So, for completeness, here's how `Iterations` differ from `Substeps`.

- **Substep** Divide each frame into smaller time steps
- **Iterations** Number of times a constraint is "resolved"

They both provide accuracy in slightly different ways. With a greater amount of substeps, the solver is effectively working in slow-motion. Everything is easier in slow-motion. Resolving constraints is independent of time and a little more technical to describe, so you can instead kind of think of it a little bit like rubbing dirt of a silver platter. The first rub, you'll get most of it off. But the more you rub, the shinier it gets. There's no limit to how much you can rub, but eventually rubbing will stop having a visible effect.

### Help Line

Hovering over any menu item now reveals a short description of what it does in the native Maya Help Line (typically at the bottom of the Maya window).

This is the same information as can be found in the [Menu Reference](/menu).
