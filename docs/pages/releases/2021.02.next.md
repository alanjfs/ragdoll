### Auto Initial State

Have you ever used the `Set Initial State` button? It's useful, isn't it? It's what enables you to turn something dynamic but then change your mind about where it should start simulating.

With this release, that process is automatic! It's more or less what you expected would happen anyway. I mean, obviously the box should drop from where you left it, rather than where it was originally turned dynamic?

## Replay

Ever set-up a character with physics, only to have to do it all over again on some other shot or character? With **Replay** this can be a thing of the past. :)

If you've ever worked with Photoshop and it's "Actions" panel, you'll know what to expect. It'll record the things you do, such that you can replay them later. For every recorded action, selection and preferences are stored. You can edit the names of selected nodes with *wildcards* to support alternative naming conventions, for example if a control has a different namespace than originally recorded at. Preferences can be manipulated post-recording as well, such as the initial shapes of things.

### DG Viewport Bug

If you've ever had the viewport "remember" old frames as you scrub the timeline, this fix is for you.
